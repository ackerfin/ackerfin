## 📌 Featured Project: TensionTracker
*“What if we could map global tensions like we track weather storms?”*

TensionTracker is an early-stage project that:
- Analyzes diplomatic trends from media & political statements (NLP)
- Uses graph mapping to show alliances/conflicts in real time
- Adds emotion detection via computer vision for summits/conferences
- Combines IR theory + tech for people who love both drama and data
